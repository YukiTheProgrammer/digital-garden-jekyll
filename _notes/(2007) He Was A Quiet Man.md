# (2007) He Was A Quiet Man
### Quick Summary:
It's about a guy who is frustrated at work and pretends to engage in violence to cope with it (i.e. blowing up the building). He is an unreliable narrator as the ending shows that the higher ups knew about his plans (or maybe that was him jsut being paranoid).
